# Pong

A very simple pong game written in Python. It uses Turtle library for everything which means you don't need to install any dependencies.
This game also has an AI which can be controlled by the user. To use AI you jsut need to set the `ai_on` variable to True.

NOTE: This game is made for my MacBook's display. If you're having some issues with display scaling please consider changing some values.
